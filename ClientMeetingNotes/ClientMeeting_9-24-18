9/24/18 – Two Cats Cafe
Client Meeting
Ryan(minutes recorder), Evan, Blake, and Bassam

Two aspects, keep track of inventory, num of cases, how many pounds sold, wanting hummus. 
Perhaps tracking all the ingredients of the items. Keep track of expensive items some items cannot be counted and this 
system will help him out. System for waste possible? E-mail would be fine but he stated any system of notification would be acceptable. 
Hard to break down larger items into smaller items, possibly implement a system to track each item individually and their respective food 
usage. Perhaps add a spoilage tracker, help him with grocery purchases. Additional information would be required.

Bassam 
  He has a history in IT.
  He also owns Damask and is planning on buying other restaurants.
  Questions Covered
  What is the current process that solves this problem?
  Is there a list of ingredients for menu items?

  How would you like to be notified?
  Do you need to know how much you’ve got left at any given time?
  At the end of the meeting, we decided to schedule another meeting on the week of the 22nd of October.
