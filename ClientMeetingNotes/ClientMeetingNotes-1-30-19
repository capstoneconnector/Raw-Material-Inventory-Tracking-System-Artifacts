  Bassam is in California
Summary
  Started programming
  Talk about the tech stack
    Changing it from XAMP to Django Python
      “Did you have to learn python?”
        No, it was one of the first languages we learned
      Easier, simpler alternative that was considered last semester
      Bassam gave us free reign when it came to choosing our tech stack
      He greatly approved of django
  We’re behind on the React front end
Here’s what we have
  This is our interface rendered in HTML
    Summary page
      Shows tracked materials
      Not currently calculating revenue or notifying expiration dates(this was for a later iteration)
      Does show the earliest expiration date
      Tracks the amount of materials 
    Material instance page
      Shows every instance of an tracked material type and the info about them
    Materials
      Allows you to add instances(batches) of materials with amounts of materials and prepared amounts to the instance page
What’s Next:
  Authentication
  Restaurants
  More information for summary page and instances
Bassam’s Comments
  “I like how you track the instances, but it needs some sort of method for tracking what’s unaccounted for”
  “We need to have timestamps for additions and updates to materials”
  “More information needs to be displayed in the summary page”
  “Show the user who made an update along with the timestamp”
  “Make the function as simple as possible, focus on keeping track of inventory”
