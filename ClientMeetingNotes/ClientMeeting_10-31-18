Client Meeting Notes
10/31/2018
  - Update of what we’ve done
  - Questions
    Do you want employees to have access to the software?
      “It depends on the functionality”
      Vague, ask for more clarification
  - Discussed punctuality/email correspondence
      We’ll communicate more through text/email
      Text him when we send him an email
  - Went through the prototype and requirements
      Headed by Evan
      Highlighted main functions, ability to work with multiple restaurants
      Suggested Changes
        “Why did you choose this format?”
            Based off professional formats
             We can change it
   - He’d like us to have authentication in the beginning, allowing other users to work on it. 
        This will include user creation
          ability to give users different permissions
   - Location based services to differentiate between two cats and damask
        Wants inventory to be tracked by
            Numbers
            Pound
            Example
              Lamb
              Bought 40 lbs
              1 order is 4 ounces
              Spent $200
              Prepared 10 lbs
              Sold 4 orders for X
              Need to convert orders to lbs (we can get orders from point of sale system)
              Track how much money this has made
              How much is left after preparation
              When the inventory reaches a critical amount, it’ll flag it for restocking
  - “You guys are going to create an inventory tracking system. How are you going to track the inventory?”
         Point of sale system
         Ideally it’ll be tracked automatically
            “It’s too complicated for you to always be in communication with it”
             “Manual is fine, but you’re gonna need a background database to track all of the information.”
          How often do you buy stock for your inventory?
            “It depends on the item, but generally weekly.”
          System should track how much of the item was added, how much this cost, how much has been prepared, how many orders have been sold, how much has been sold, how much money was made, how much remains. 
  - Web App vs Desktop App vs Mobile App
        Up to Bassam
        He rather have us focus on the solution to the database right now
        Get back to that question later
  - Next Meeting
      November 19th (Week of Thanksgiving)
      Monday
