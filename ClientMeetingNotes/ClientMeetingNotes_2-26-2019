Held over Skype
Blake Prescott was the minute recorder
Summary
	We abandoned ReactJS
	Barebones authentication
	Tracking activity
		dates/users who updated things
Demo over screen sharing
	Login required now
	When an instance is added it’ll display who updated it and when they updated it
	The admin panel will show info about who did what
Background tasks for notifications and hosting
  Bassam has no preference as far as hosting goes
Creating user accounts
  Do you want people to be able to register accounts (for security purposes)?
    Do you want an email or something?
    “Make a hierarchical system where there’s an admin who can give registered users permissions/privileges. Allow for flexibility. Allows us to keep records of who did what.”
    “Right now just have it be controlled by an admin”


Bassam’s Comments
	Get one restaurant working before we have it go for multiple restaurants.
		(focus on history changes and such)
  I want to be more involved in what you guys are doing as far as progress reports go.
  I’d like to meet in person next time if possible.
