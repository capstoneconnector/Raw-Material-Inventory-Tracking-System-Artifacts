**Summary**:
Overall, we very much enjoyed our time at the symposium. Most of our poster visitors asked about Two Cats and why they had shut down. 
However, most (if not all) stayed to hear the details about our project. We had a demo present, but very few individuals tried it out.
We had five totaly visitors, though we believe we could have had more with a better poster location. One of our visitors was professor
Largent. He asked us a lot about our tech stack, how CS 222 prepared us for the class, and what planning mechanisms we used for the 
project. Most of our visitors really loved that we were working on a project relevant to Two Cats and were very interested in the fact
we had the project developed.
