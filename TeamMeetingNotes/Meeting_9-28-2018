9/28/2018 - CS Lounge
Team meeting 
Present: Ryan, Blake, Evan

Notes from after the presentation:
  Ask Bassam about
    If he orders from a distributor
    What his ordering process is (tablet, cash register, other)
    Expectations as to how automatic the process is 

Requirements:
  As the restaurant owner, I want to be notified when certain high cost materials need to be restocked.
  As the restaurant owner, I want to be notified when selected materials are about to expire.
  As the restaurant owner, I want to see a prediction of when a material is going to go out of stock. 

  As the restaurant owner, I want to know how much material I have left at any given time.
  As the restaurant owner, I want to know how much material is being used in different menu items. 

  As the restaurant owner, I want to know the cost of materials being used in menu items. 
  As an owner of multiple restaurants, I want to be able to adapt this to other restaurants. 

  As the restaurant owner, I want to be able to add and remove specific ingredients from the list of tracked items.
  As the restaurant owner, I want to be able to see how much of each material was used at the end of day/week/month. 

Brainstorming:
  -If we are able to get information from his payment method automatically, we will be able to create software that tracks his 
  sales and allows us to track his use of material through that. However, whether or not we can do that depends on his current 
  payment system.
  -We could have him input it manually.
  -We could have the kitchen staff input it manually.
  -We could have an algorithm that generates a margin for error on how much material he has left.




Useful Technology:
  Flutter
    -Googleâ€™s SDK for iOS and Android app development
    -Works great with Firebase
    -Object-oriented
    -Easy transition from Java/Python and quick to learn (especially compared to React Native) 
  Firebase
    -Used great with Flutter, but may have too many limitations.
  Visual Studio Code
    -Easy to setup projects
    -Works great with version control
    -Good for app development using React Native and Flutter
    Great for programming using react
  React
    -If we need to design a web page instead, react is a useful Javascript Library
    -Making a web page that functions well on smartphone browsers would be great too. 
    -Lets Bassam input data and analyze data both on his desktop and phone. 
    However, it may come with a large learning curve.
