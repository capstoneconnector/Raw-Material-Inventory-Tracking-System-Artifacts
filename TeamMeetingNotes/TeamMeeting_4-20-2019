Met over Discord
Discussed how we still haven’t been able to get in contact with Bassam
Discussed what we’re doing for acceptance testing since Bassam has yet to respond to any of our emails
	We’re going to have people who have worked in restaurants try the software
	This requires us to move our presentation to Thursday
Prepared for presentation using what we already have
