**Description:** Bassam wants to utilize a software to track the raw material in his restaurant. In restaurants, 
ingredients are bought in bulk sizes and used in small sizes for each food. He wants to track how much ingredients 
are used at the end of the day/week/month for specific menu items. He also wants to calculate and track the cost of each
