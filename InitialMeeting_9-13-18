Project Information

Contact: Bassam Helwani
Title: Owner of Two Cats Cafe, Muncie
Email: bassamhelwani@gmail.com

Description: Bassam wants to utilize a software to track the raw material in his restaurant. In restaurants, ingredients are bought 
in bulk sizes and used in small sizes for each food. He wants to track how much ingredients are used at the end of 
the day/week/month for specific menu items. He also wants to calculate and track the cost of each ingredient in a food item. 
The system will also allow him to create notifications about certain raw materials when Bassam needs to restock them.

Initial Questions & Thoughts:

What is Two Cats’ story?
What is the current process that solves this problem?
Is there a list of ingredients for menu items?
How often do you restock?
How much do you buy in bulk?
Cost?
How would you like to be notified? (Computer software, email, mobile app/notification?
What is your current system for making transactions?
Do you need to know how much you’ve got left at any given time?
What day of the week works for you for our monthly meeting?
What form of communication works best for you?
Do monthly meetings work for you?
